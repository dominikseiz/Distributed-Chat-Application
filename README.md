This project presents the results of a group work within the module "Distributed Systems" 
in the master course "Digital Business Engineering" at the Herman Hollerith Zentrum 
(Reutlingen  University  of  Applied  Sciences)  in  BÃ¶blingen/Germany.  The  goal  of  the 
project for the students is to implement a distributed system with concrete requirements. 
These  requirements  include:  dynamic  discovery  of  hosts,  implementation  of  voting 
algorithms, implementation of ordered reliable multicast and a system that is tolerant to 
crash faults.
